    # method it calls when it likes, while typical flow is to pass
    # a block and then callbacks will be called.
    #
    # This wrapper bridges the 2 worlds using ruby Queues to simulate the
    # blocking receive expectation MCollective has thanks to its initial
    # design around the Stomp gem.
