Manage an AIO Installation of The Marionette Collective
=======================================================

This module manages a Puppet AIO based MCollective.

It makes default decisions that are compatible with AIO and tries to get as
close to working out of the box with no complex config or decision making needed
on the side of the user.

The module can be used standalone but it's designed to work with Choria - a companion
suite of plugins that makes a AIO based MCollective easy to install and use.

Follow the guide at the [Choria Website](http://choria.io) for installation details
