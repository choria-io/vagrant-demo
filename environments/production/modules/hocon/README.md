## Overview

This module adds resource types to manage settings in HOCON-style configuration files.

## Module Description

The hocon module adds a resource type so that you can use Puppet to manage settings in HOCON configuration files.

## Setup

## Beginning with hocon

To manage a HOCON file, add the resource type `hocon_setting` to a class.

## Usage

Manage individual settings in HOCON files by adding the `hocon_setting` resource type to a class. For example:

```
hocon_setting { "sample setting":
  ensure  => present,
  path    => '/tmp/foo.conf',
  setting => 'foosetting',
  value   => 'FOO!',
}
```

To control a setting nested within a map contained at another setting, provide the path to that setting
under the "setting" parameter, with each level separated by a ".". So to manage `barsetting` in the following map

```
foo : {
    bar : {
        barsetting : "FOO!"
    }
}
```

You would put the following in your manifest:

```
hocon_setting {'sample nested setting':
  ensure  => present,
  path => '/tmp/foo.conf',
  setting => 'foo.bar.barsetting',
  value   => 'BAR!',
}
```

You can also set maps like so:

```
hocon_setting { 'sample map setting':
  ensure => present,
  path => '/tmp/foo.conf',
  setting => 'hash_setting',
  value => { 'a' => 'b' },
}
```

## Reference

### Type: hocon_setting

#### Parameters

##### `ensure`

Ensures that the resource is present. 

Values: 'present', 'absent'

Default: 'present'

##### `path`

The HOCON file in which Puppet will ensure the specified setting.

This parameter, along with `setting`, is one of two namevars for the `hocon_setting` type, meaning that Puppet will give an error if two `hocon_setting` resources have the same `setting` and `path` parameters.

Values: a path tring

Default: `undef`

##### `setting`

The name of the HOCON file setting to be defined. This can be a top-level setting or a setting nested within another setting. To define a nested setting, give the full path to that setting with each level separated by a `.` So, to define a setting `foosetting` nested within a setting called `foo` contained on the top level, the `setting` parameter would be set to `foo.foosetting`. This parameter, along with `path`, is one of two namevars for the `hocon_setting` type, meaning that Puppet will give an error if two `hocon_setting` resources have the same `setting` and `path` parameters.

If no `setting` value is explicitly set, the title of the resource will be used as the value of `setting`.

Default: `namevar`

##### `value`

The value of the HOCON file setting to be defined.

Default: `undef`

##### `type`

The type of the value passed into the `value` parameter. This value should be a string, with valid values being `'number'`, `'boolean'`, `'string'`, `'hash'`, `'array'`, `'array_element'`, and `'text'`.

This parameter will not be need to be set most of the time, as the module is generally smart enough to figure this out on its own. There are only three cases in which this parameter is required.

The first is the case in which the `value` type is a single-element array. In that case, the `type` parameter will need to be set to `'array'`. So, for example, to add a single-element array, you would add the following to your manifest

```
hocon_setting { 'single array setting':
  ensure => present,
  path => '/tmp/foo.conf',
  setting => 'foo',
  value => [1],
  type => 'array',
}
```

If you are trying to manage single entries in an array (for example, adding to an array from a define) you will need to set the `'type'` parameter to `'array_element'`. For example, to add to an existing array in the 'foo' setting, you can add the following to your manifest

```
hocon_setting { 'add to array':
  ensure  => present,
  path    => '/tmp/foo.conf',
  setting => 'foo',
  value   => 2,
  type    => 'array_element',
}
```

Note: When adding an item via 'array_element', the array must already exist in the HOCON file.

Since this type represents a setting in a configuration file, you can pass a string containing the exact text of the value as you want it to appear in the file (this is useful, for example, if you want to set a parameter to a map or an array but want comments or specific indentation on elements in the map/array). In this case, `value` must be a string with no leading or trailing whitespace, newlines, or comments that contains a valid HOCON value, and the `type` parameter must be set to `'text'`. This is an advanced use case, and will not be necessary for most users. So, for example, say you want to add a map with particular indentation/comments into your configuration file at path `foo.bar`. You could create a variable like so 

```
$map =
"{
    # This is setting a
    a : b
    # This is setting c
        c : d
  }"
```

And your configuration file looks like so

```
baz : qux
foo : {
  a : b
}
```

You could then write the following in your manifest

```
hocon_setting { 'exact text setting':
  ensure => present,
  path => '/tmp/foo.conf',
  setting => 'foo.bar',
  value => $map,
  type => 'text',
}
```

And the resulting configuration file would look like so

```
baz : qux
foo : {
  a : b
  bar : {
      # This is setting a
      a : b
      # This is setting c
          c : d
  }
}
```

Aside from these three cases, the `type` parameter does not need to be set.

## Development

Puppet Labs modules on the Puppet Forge are open projects, and community contributions are essential for keeping them great. We canâ€™t access the huge number of platforms and myriad of hardware, software, and deployment configurations that Puppet is intended to serve.

We want to keep it as easy as possible to contribute changes so that our modules work in your environment. There are a few guidelines that we need contributors to follow so that we can have a chance of keeping on top of things.

You can read the complete module contribution guide on the [Puppet Labs wiki](http://projects.puppetlabs.com/projects/module-site/wiki/Module_contributing).
