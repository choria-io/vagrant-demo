## Overview

This module provides functions and facts that are out of scope for [stdlib](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-stdlib).
Some of them are even intrinsically tied to stdlib.

## Setup

```console
 % puppet module install puppet-extlib
```

## Usage

Since `puppet/extlib` version 3, all functions are provided under the `extlib` namespace.
Non namespaced versions are available in this release, but deprecated and will be removed in the next major release.

All functions are documented in [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md)

## Limitations

Some functions require puppetlabs-stdlib (>= 4.6.0) and all functions are only compatible with Puppet 4.7 and later.

## Development

We highly welcome new contributions to this module, especially those that
include documentation, and rspec tests ;) but will happily guide you through
the process, so, yes, please submit that pull request!

Reference documentation is generated using puppet-strings.
To regenerate it, please run the rake task as follows.

```console
bundle exec rake reference
```
