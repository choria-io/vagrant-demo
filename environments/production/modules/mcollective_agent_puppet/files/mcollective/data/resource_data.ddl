usage <<-EOU
This data resource can be used to act based the management state
of a resource various properties related to resources of the most
recent Puppet Catalog run.

To act on machines managing /srv/www:

    -S "resource('file[/srv/www]').managed = true"

Or machines that had failed resources in their most recent run:

    -S "resource().failed_resources > 0"

Or ones that were particularly slow at applying their catalogs:

    -S "resource().total_time > 360"
