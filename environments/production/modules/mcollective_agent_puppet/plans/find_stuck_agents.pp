# Locates agents stuck applying for extended periods of time
#
# When running Puppet in unstable networks one often finds a Puppet Agent stuck
# thinking it's applying a catalog when the applying process have been in the
# process tree for hours or days or weeks and will never die.
#
# This playbook detects these agents and returns a list of affected host, you could
# use this to kill them via some other method of your choice
#
# @param nodes [Choria::Nodes] The nodes to limit the search on, else with the Puppet agent
# @param maxage [Integer] Maximum amount of time between now and last completed run
# @returns [Choria::Nodes] list of stuck nodes
